# Sign-Up Form

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s Node.js Path's Intermediate HTML & CSS course.

This project is meant to serve as practice replicating a design that's already been made as well as practicing form validation and creation, UX, as well as the other various HTML and CSS tidbits that have been shown throughout the intermediate HTML & CSS course.
